# Project ideas  
Here is a list, in no particular order, of things you could do for a project  
* Use the information in snpedia.com and an individual's genotype report from a public database (https://opensnp.org or http://www.personalgenomes.org/harvard/data) to find out how much one can learn from an individual based on their SNPs  
* Explain and extend the forensic analysis performed in __Foster, Eugene A., et al. "Jefferson fathered slave's last child." Nature 396.6706 (1998): 27-28__
